I created this responsive, visually engaging webpage to showcase one of my favorite hobbiesâ€”console gaming! This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and highlights key skills including:

Responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
Custom button styling and hover effects
Dynamic light/dark theme toggle via JavaScript
Image hover animations to enhance interactivity
Clean, user-focused layout and accessibility practices

This was a fun way to blend my passion for tech and gaming into a creative front-end project. You can check out the live preview or explore the code
